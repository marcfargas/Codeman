# prebuild, so a release that bumps it compiles from source right here. Without
# a toolchain that install fails and the update rolls back — every time, on the
# releases that need it most. Same reason install.sh installs one on bare hosts.

# The Docker CLI, taken from the official image rather than Debian's `docker.io`.
# That package is the full ENGINE: with --no-install-recommends it still pulls 15
# packages including containerd, runc, dmsetup and iptables, none of which a
# client that only talks to a mounted socket can use. Measured on top of this
# base image: `docker.io` costs 266 MB and ships Docker 20.10.24 (2023), while
# these two files cost 108 MB and ship the current CLI (493 MB vs 335 MB total).
#
# The binaries are STATIC Go builds, so they run on this glibc image even though
# the image they come from is Alpine (verified: `docker --version`, `docker ps`
# and `docker build` all work here against a mounted host socket).
#
# buildx is copied on purpose. `scripts/build-agent-image.mjs` shells out to
# `docker build` — Codeman auto-builds the agent image on the first Docker case —
# and without the plugin that silently falls back to the CLASSIC builder, which
# Docker has deprecated and will eventually drop. `docker-compose` is NOT copied:
# Codeman never shells out to it.

# Keep credentials out of the image. Users authenticate these CLIs at runtime
# through Codeman sessions, and the configured host bind mount retains state.
#
# ⚠️ PINNED ON PURPOSE. Unpinned, the agent CLI versions a user ends up with are
# a function of WHEN their image was built, not of any commit — so a Codeman
# release that depends on newer CLI behaviour (the trust-dialog handling is
# pinned to Claude Code 2.1.252's layout; wheel forwarding to >= 2.1.187) breaks
# on an older image with no diff anywhere to explain why. In-app updates make
# rebuilds RARER, which makes that drift worse. Pinning turns "this release needs
# a newer CLI" into a Dockerfile change, which the updater's environment gate
# already detects and refuses (docs/docker-self-update.md).
#
# Bump these deliberately, in a release. `--no-cache` is still needed to rebuild
# this layer when only the pins change upstream.
