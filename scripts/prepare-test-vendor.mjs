/**
 * Populate `src/web/public/vendor/` with the browser bundles the mobile tests need.
 *
 * The mobile suite (test/mobile/**) drives a real browser against a WebServer
 * started from TypeScript source, so fastify-static serves
 * `join(__dirname, 'public')` = `src/web/public`, NOT `dist/web/public`, where
 * `npm run build` puts the vendor bundles. Without them every `/vendor/xterm*`
 * request 404s, so `Terminal` is never defined, `initTerminal()` never runs, and
 * every test touching `app.terminal` dies with `Cannot read properties of null`.
 *
 * That stayed invisible because config/vitest.ci.config.ts excludes
 * `test/mobile/**`, so CI never ran the suite.
 *
 * ⚠️ scripts/postinstall.js:238-303 already writes these same 7 outputs (same
 * names, same alias tail), so a plain `npm install` leaves the suite working. What
 * this script adds is FRESHNESS and independence from install time: a checkout
 * installed with `--ignore-scripts`, or one borrowing another tree's
 * `node_modules`, never ran postinstall, and an edit to the zerolag package after
 * install leaves the bundle stale. It runs as `pretest:mobile`.
 *
 * Mirrors the vendor steps in scripts/build.mjs, targeting the source tree. Same
 * inputs and output names, so the page markup needs no test-only branch. That
 * makes THREE hand-synced copies of this asset table (here, build.mjs:45-51,
 * postinstall.js:255-303); keep them in step or a missing entry becomes a 404 that
 * silently disables the terminal.
 * `src/web/public/vendor/` is gitignored, so these stay build artifacts.
 *
 * Idempotent: skips outputs that are complete and newer than every input they
 * derive from.
