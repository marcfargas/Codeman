/**
 * @fileoverview A phone tab's tap-to-switch area must stay bigger than its
 * action icons.
 *
 * The active tab is the only one that grows a gear and a close button, and on a
 * phone they were eating it: with a short session name ("w1", "api") the label
 * rendered 13-16px wide while gear + close took 50px of a 116px tab, so the
 * tab's geometric CENTRE landed on the gear. Aiming a thumb at the middle of
 * the tab opened Session Options instead of switching sessions, measured at
 * 360, 393 and 430px.
 *
 * `min-width` on the active tab's name is what fixes it, and this guard pins the
 * arithmetic behind the number rather than the number itself.
 *
 * ⚠️ The governing case is the 10th tab onward, NOT the tabs you can see.
 * `.tab-number` is rendered only for `_tabIdx < 9` (app.js), so tab 10 loses
 * 16px + a 4px gap off its left and its centre sits 10px further right. Measured
 * in Chromium at 393px: a NUMBERED tab clears the gear once the label reserves
 * 20px, a numberless one needs 40px. Reasoning from the tabs on screen is
 * exactly what would put the centre back on the gear.
 *
 * The centre sits left of the icons when
 *
 *     reserved > icons + rightEdge - leftRunUp - gap
 *
 * which is what `requiredReserve()` below recomputes from the stylesheet, so
 * widening the gear or the padding fails here instead of on someone's phone.
 * Note this is "off the icons", not "inside the label": on a numberless tab the
 * centre lands in the 4px gap between the name and the icons, which still
 * switches sessions, because the click handler is on the tab and gear/close
 * both `stopPropagation()`.
 *
 * Parsed with postcss instead of a regex because the declarations live in a
 * nested `@media` block. Behaviour (the tap itself, the gear still opening
 * options, tablets unaffected) is covered live in a browser; this file is the
 * cheap regression fence. Port: N/A.
