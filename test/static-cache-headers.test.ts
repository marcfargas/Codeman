/**
 * @fileoverview `@fastify/static`'s `setHeaders` callback is what sets Cache-Control
 * on every asset Codeman serves, and v10 silently changed its contract.
 *
 * In v9 the first argument was a Node `ServerResponse`, so the body called
 * `res.setHeader(...)`. In v10 it is a `FastifyReply`, which has no `setHeader`, so
 * the v9 body throws `TypeError: res.setHeader is not a function` from inside
 * `@fastify/static` on EVERY static request. Nothing in the type-checker catches a
 * revert (the callback's parameter is inferred), and nothing else in the suite reads
 * these headers, so without this file the whole caching contract is untested.
 *
 * That contract is load-bearing: assets are served `immutable` for a year, and
 * `index.html` must revalidate every time or a deploy leaves browsers on stale
 * markup (see `cacheBustAssets` in server.ts).
 *
 * These tests drive a REAL WebServer on purpose. Asserting against an inline
 * re-registration of the plugin would keep passing after a revert in server.ts.
