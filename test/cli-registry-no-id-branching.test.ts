/**
 * @fileoverview Static guard: no code outside the stock catalog branches on a CLI's ID.
 *
 * The whole point of the registry is that behaviour which differs between CLIs is DATA (a
 * `CliEntry` field) or a NAMED PROFILE selected by a field — never `mode === 'codex'`. A
 * single reintroduced id-check is how the old shape grows back, one "just this once" at a
 * time, until adding a CLI means editing forty files again.
 *
 * This guard was cited by name in three separate file headers of an earlier attempt at this
 * refactor and never actually written — and in its absence four id-branches survived that
 * migration, one of them dead code sitting directly under the generic check that replaced it.
 * So the guard is not decoration: it is the thing that makes the rule true rather than
 * aspirational.
 *
 * ## What is allowlisted, and why an allowlist rather than zero
 *
 * Some branches are not CLI-behaviour branches at all, and forcing them through a capability
 * would make the code worse, not better. Each entry below carries its reason. The categories:
 *
 *  - **Legacy `<Mode>Config` plumbing.** `POST /api/sessions` has carried named per-CLI
 *    config objects since before the registry, and `docs/versioning-policy.md` makes that
 *    wire shape public. Selecting `codexConfig` for codex is a fact about the HTTP API, not
 *    about codex, and the `Session` constructor mirrors it. The registry already owns the
 *    translation (`launch.legacyConfigField`); collapsing the constructor too is a public-API
 *    change and belongs in its own PR.
 *  - **Claude's remote/docker command construction.** Claude's pane command varies with the
 *    session's permission mode and its docker form is `--session-id … || resume`, semantics
 *    no other CLI has and a static `overlays.command` string cannot express.
 *  - **Genuinely per-CLI prose.** One error message that explains why a deepseek session in
 *    particular will never deliver a `stop` signal.
 *
 * ⚠️ Adding an entry here is a decision, not a formality. If the branch is about what a CLI
 * CAN DO, it belongs in `CliCapabilities` instead — and if it needs to run code, in
 * `config/cli-registry/profiles.ts` as a named profile.
 *
 * Port: none (pure static analysis).
