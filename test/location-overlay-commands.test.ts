/**
 * @fileoverview Golden pins for the remote/docker LOCATION OVERLAY commands, now that both
 * are read from `overlays.<location>` on the registry entry rather than from a hardcoded
 * `Record<…CommandMode, string>` in each file.
 *
 * The literals below are transcribed from those two tables as they stood BEFORE the wiring,
 * which is the whole point: the tables were dead-simple duplicates of registry data with
 * nothing keeping the two in step, and the way to delete a duplicate safely is to pin what it
 * produced first. A diff here means an entry's `overlays` (or its first declared binary)
 * changed what a remote or in-container pane actually runs.
 *
 * Note the two arms deliberately NOT read from an entry, each for its own reason: remote
 * `shell` resolves the REMOTE user's login shell (unknowable from here, hence `$SHELL`), and
 * docker `shell` is the entry that declares `docker: { disabled: true }` — a container has no
 * per-user login shell to resolve, so it gets a plain `bash -l`.
 *
 * Port: none (pure, over registry data).
