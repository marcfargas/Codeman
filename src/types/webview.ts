/**
 * @fileoverview Web tab (dashboard) types.
 *
 * A "webview" is a saved URL that Codeman renders as a tab alongside agent
 * sessions: Grafana on :3000, a Uptime-Kuma on :4000, an internal status page.
 * It is deliberately NOT a sixth `SessionMode`, it has no PTY, no tmux, no
 * respawn and no idle detection. Same reasoning that keeps Docker and remote-SSH
 * as case overlays rather than modes.
 *
 * Key exports:
 * - Webview, the persisted record (`~/.codeman/webviews.json`).
 * - WebviewEmbedMode, 'proxy' (served through Codeman's origin) or 'direct'
 *   (a plain cross-origin iframe, only viable for HTTPS targets that allow framing).
 * - WebviewProbe, the result of the server-side reachability/framing probe.
 * - WebviewOpenData, what `POST /api/webviews/:id/open` hands the browser.
 *
 * No I/O here. Persistence lives in `src/webview-store.ts`, capability minting in
 * `src/webview-capabilities.ts`, the proxy helpers in `src/web/webview-proxy.ts`.
 */

/**
 * How the browser should embed a webview.
 *
 * - `proxy`: the iframe points at `/webview/<capability>/` on Codeman's own
 *   origin and the server relays to the target. Required whenever the target is
 *   plain HTTP (an HTTPS Codeman page cannot embed it: mixed content) or refuses
 *   framing via `X-Frame-Options` / `frame-ancestors`.
 * - `direct`: the iframe points at the target URL itself. Cheaper, but only works
 *   for HTTPS targets that permit framing, and needs the target origin added to
 *   the page CSP's `frame-src`.
