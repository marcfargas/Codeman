/**
 * @fileoverview Registry-driven CLI binary resolution: look up ANY registered CLI's binary
 * directory, version and not-found message from its `CliEntry`, with no per-CLI branch.
 *
 * This is a LAYER over `cli-executable-resolver.ts`, not a replacement for it. That module
 * still owns the lookup chain (process PATH → the entry's search dirs → an interactive
 * login shell), the negative cache and its doubling backoff, the marker-fenced login-shell
 * parse, the `SIGKILL` timeouts and the vitest hermeticity gate — all of it deliberately
 * untouched here, because those guards are load-bearing and separately tested. What this
 * module adds is: where the parameters come from (the registry, rather than seven
 * hand-written constant blocks) and what makes a candidate acceptable.
 *
 * CANDIDATE VALIDATION runs in a fixed order, and the order is the point:
 *
 *   1. IDENTITY (`discovery.identity`) — does the binary say it is the program we meant?
 *      Checked FIRST, because a version probe cannot tell an impostor from the real thing:
 *      Debian's `dsh` (dancer's shell) answers `--version` perfectly happily, and npm
 *      carries squatters for both `pi` and `grok`.
 *   2. VERSION (`discovery.version`) — does its version output have the right shape? With
 *      `requireVersionMatch`, a mismatch means ABSENT rather than present-with-unknown-
 *      version, which is what a short, generic binary name needs.
 *
 * Both probes EXECUTE the candidate, which is exactly why both are gated off under vitest:
 * a suite must never depend on — let alone run — whatever binary of that name the machine
 * running it happens to carry. Tests inject probes instead.
 *

 * caller asks `cliNeedsVersionProbe()` whether this CLI gates anything on its version and
 * then asks HERE for that CLI's version. Before this, all three call sites asked
 * `cliNeedsVersionProbe()` a generic question and then called `getClaudeCliVersion()`
