/**
 * @fileoverview Implementations of the LAUNCHER profiles named by `discovery.launcherProfile`.
 *
 * A launcher CLI's binary is not the agent — it boots some further target — so two questions
 * the registry normally answers from the binary alone have to be asked of that target:
 *
 *   - `isCliRunnable(id)`  — stricter than "is the binary on disk?"
 *   - `launcherDefaultTarget(entry)` — what to launch when the caller names no target
 *
 * The profile NAMES and their validation live in `config/cli-registry/profiles.ts`, which is
 * kept free of imports so `schema.ts` can validate a name at load time. The implementations
 * live here because they reach into resolvers that reach back into the registry, and holding
 * them next to the names would close an import cycle.
 *
 * ⚠️ Everything in this file is keyed by PROFILE NAME, never by CLI id. A new launcher CLI
 * adds a profile here and names it from its entry; it does not add a branch anywhere else.
 *
 * @module utils/cli-launcher
