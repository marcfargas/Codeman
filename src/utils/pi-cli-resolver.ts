/**
 * @fileoverview Resolve the Pi CLI (`pi`) binary across common install paths.
 *
 * Mirrors antigravity-cli-resolver.ts, with one addition the other external-CLI
 * resolvers do not need: `pi` is a SHORT, GENERIC name (Raspberry Pi tooling,
 * personal scripts, `$PATH` accidents), so a `which pi` hit is not by itself
 * evidence that the coding agent is installed. Every candidate is therefore
 * sanity-probed with `pi --version` and required to print a semver-shaped
 * string; a binary that fails the probe is treated as absent and the rejected
 * path is logged so a misresolution is diagnosable.
 *
 * Pi ships as the npm package `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, so the search
 * dirs are the usual global-bin locations (npm/bun/manual installs).
