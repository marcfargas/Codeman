/**
 * @fileoverview Resolve the Grok Build CLI (`grok`, xAI) binary across common install paths.
 *
 * Mirrors pi-cli-resolver.ts, version probe included: `grok` is another short
 * name with known squatters (the unrelated `@vibe-kit/grok-cli` npm package also
 * installs a `grok` bin), so a `which grok` hit is not by itself evidence that
 * xAI's coding agent is installed. Every candidate is sanity-probed with
 * `grok --version` and required to print a version-shaped string (the real CLI
 * prints `grok 1.0.5 (5115b46bc9)`); a binary that fails the probe is treated
 * as absent and the rejected path is logged. The probe cannot tell two
 * version-printing `grok`s apart, which is why `GET /api/grok/status` surfaces
 * path AND version: a misresolution is diagnosable rather than presenting as
 * "the mode just doesn't work".
 *
 * The official installer (`curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash`)
 * places the binary in `~/.grok/bin` and symlinks it into `~/.local/bin`, so
 * those two head the search list.
