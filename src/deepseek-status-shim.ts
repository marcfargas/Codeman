/**
 * @fileoverview The DeepSeek Harness -> Codeman status bridge.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Every external CLI mode before this one (opencode, codex, gemini, antigravity,
 * pi, grok) is READINESS-GUESSED: Codeman watches the PTY go quiet and infers a
 * turn ended. Claude is the exception, because Claude Code fires real hooks. The
 * DeepSeek Harness TUI gives us a third option, and a much better one than
 * guessing: the community terminal front door already reports its own lifecycle
 * to an owning supervisor, and it does so through a fully GENERIC, env-var-gated
 * contract it inherited from Herdr (herdr.dev).
 *
 * When all three of `HERDR_ENV=1`, `HERDR_BIN_PATH` and `HERDR_PANE_ID` are set,
 * the TUI shells out on every state change:
 *
 *     "$HERDR_BIN_PATH" pane report-agent "$HERDR_PANE_ID" \
 *         --source custom:dsh-tui --agent dsh-tui \
 *         --state idle|working|blocked [--message <text>] --seq <n>
 *
 * and treats exit code 0 as "delivered" (retrying with backoff otherwise). So
 * Codeman points `HERDR_BIN_PATH` at the script below and gets DEFINITIVE
 * idle/working/blocked signals for dsh sessions: real respawn triggers, real
 * `wait`/`wait-output` stop+blocked signals, and real Approvals Inbox items,
 * on par with Claude's hooks rather than with output stabilization.
 *
 * This is an interface implementation, not an impersonation: we implement the
 * one verb (`pane report-agent`) that the contract defines, and nothing on the
 * machine ever executes a real `herdr` binary — `HERDR_BIN_PATH` is our own
 * script, in our own data dir. `HERDR_ENV=1` is the flag the TUI checks to know
 * a supervisor is present; a supervisor IS present, it is Codeman.
 *
 * ## Why it is generated rather than committed
 *
 * The shim must be an executable file at a stable absolute path in every
 * install shape: a git clone (where `scripts/` exists), an `npm i -g aicodeman`
 * (where `files` ships only `dist` plus two named scripts), and any
 * `CODEMAN_INSTANCE`. Writing it into the data dir at session-create time makes
 * one code path cover all of them, single-sources the content here in TS, and
 * follows the precedent of `self-update-runner.sh`. It is rewritten whenever the
 * embedded version marker changes, so an upgraded Codeman refreshes a stale shim
 * without the user knowing it exists.

 * Mapping from the harness's three lifecycle states to Codeman hook events.
 *
 * - `blocked` -> `permission_prompt`: the TUI reports blocked when a tool
 *   approval or an `ask_user_question` questionnaire is on screen, which is
 *   exactly the red "needs you" alert and an answerable Approvals Inbox item.
 * - `idle` -> `stop`: the definitive end-of-turn signal, the one respawn and the
 *   wait endpoints care about.
 * - `working` -> `agent_working`: a turn STARTED. Codeman infers "working" from
 *   PTY output well enough on its own, but the event is what RESOLVES a pending
 *   approval when the user answers a dialog in the terminal instead of in the
 *   inbox. Without it a dsh session's red alert would survive until the next
 *   `stop`, which is the exact stuck-alert bug the claude path already had to
 *   fix once (and the pane-capture staleness sweep that fixed it there is
 *   Claude-dialog-shaped, so it cannot help here).

/**
 * The generated script.
 *
 * Constraints it must satisfy, each learned from an existing Codeman hook bug:
 * - **TLS**: `CODEMAN_API_URL` is loopback HTTPS with a self-signed cert on
 *   `--https`/tailscale installs, so certificate verification is disabled for
 *   the request. Without this the whole bridge dies silently, exactly as the
 *   claude hook curls did before they grew `-k`.
 * - **Secret**: the hook-secret file is read AT EXECUTION TIME, never baked in,
 *   so rotation needs no respawn and the value never lands on a command line.
 * - **Exit codes**: 0 means delivered. Anything else makes the TUI retry with
 *   backoff, so transport failures self-heal, but an unknown verb or an
 *   unmapped state exits 0 to avoid a pointless retry storm over something that
 *   will never succeed.
 * - **Timeout**: bounded below the caller's own 2s budget, so we lose the race
 *   deliberately rather than being killed mid-flight.
