/**
 * @fileoverview Supervises the one background `dsh web` process behind the Run
 * menu's "DeepSeek web UI..." entry.
 *
 * The shortcut originally started the server inside an ordinary SHELL SESSION,
 * on the reasoning that Codeman already knows how to supervise those: it was
 * visible, scrollable, killable, and died with its tab, and nothing new had to
 * own a long-lived HTTP server. That reasoning was sound and the result was
 * still wrong in use — clicking "open the DeepSeek web UI" spawned a terminal
 * tab the user never asked for, next to the web tab they did, and the terminal
 * was noise every time after the first.
 *
 * So the server moves here instead: one child process, no session, no tab.
 * What that buys back has to be paid for explicitly, which is what this module
 * is:
 *
 * - **Exactly one.** A second click reuses the running server rather than
 *   racing it for a port. The old shell-session flow could not do this at all,
 *   because two clicks were simply two sessions.
 * - **Restarted when the authority changes.** `--trusted-host` fences dsh's
 *   `/api` against the browser authority, and a Codeman reachable at both
 *   loopback and a tailnet name has two. Whoever asks last wins, because the
 *   asker is by definition the origin about to load the page.
 * - **Killed on shutdown.** A detached child that outlived Codeman would hold
 *   its port against the next start, which is exactly the EADDRINUSE this
 *   feature already got wrong once.
 * - **Failures reported, not swallowed.** The shell tab used to be where the
 *   stack trace landed. With no tab, the spawn's own output is captured and
 *   handed back to the caller instead.
