/**
 * @fileoverview Shared sensitive-path blocklist.
 *
 * A small defense-in-depth blocklist of absolute paths that must never be
 * served to the browser regardless of how the path was obtained (workspace
 * download, cross-workspace attachment registration, raw/preview serving).
 *
 * This is intentionally a BLOCKLIST, not a workspace-confinement check:
 * cross-workspace attachment is a supported feature (codeman-publish skill +
 * the automated review-card loop attaching files under ~/.codeman/), so a
 * strict session-workspace boundary would break legitimate use. The blocklist
 * rejects well-known secret locations (system password files, SSH keys, cloud
 * credentials, dotenv files) while leaving ordinary cross-workspace files
 * attachable.
 *
 * ⚠️ The path picker's `showHidden` option is what makes the dot-prefixed half
 * of this list load-bearing. Before it existed, the picker refused every path
 * with a hidden segment, so `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` and friends were
 * unreachable by construction and the list only had to cover the few secrets
 * that live in plain sight. Opting into hidden entries removes that accident,
 * so every credential location below has to be named. Adding a new browse
 * surface means re-reading this file, not assuming it already covers you.
 *
 * ⚠️ Deliberately NOT whole-tree blocks: `~/.codeman/` (the publish skill
 * attaches from it) and `~/.claude/` (transcripts and team state are ordinary
 * files worth attaching). Only their secret-bearing members are named.
 *
 * Callers MUST resolve symlinks (realpath) BEFORE calling isSensitivePath so a
 * symlink pointing at a sensitive target is also caught.
