/**
 * @fileoverview Bounded in-memory index of PAST sessions, harvested by `GET /api/search`.
 *
 * `GET /api/search` used to build its session corpus from the live in-memory
 * session map alone, so a folder sitting in the home screen's "Resume
 * Conversation" list matched nothing (issue #261). The corpus that list renders
 * comes from `GET /api/sessions/unified`, which reads the lifecycle log and every
 * Claude transcript file: disk I/O the search path deliberately does not do (its
 * no-fs property is what keeps a per-keystroke query cheap and traversal-free).
 *
 * This module is the seam between the two: a capped snapshot of the unified list
 * that the search route reads synchronously, refreshed OUT of the request path.
 * Two things fill it:
 *   1. `/api/sessions/unified` writes it as a side effect (free, it just merged
 *      that list). The home screen calls that endpoint whenever it opens, which
 *      is the same screen the search box lives on, so it is warm in practice.
 *   2. `ensureHistorySessionIndexFresh()`, fire-and-forget, single-flight,
 *      TTL-guarded, kicks the registered refresher when a search finds the
 *      snapshot stale. The caller never awaits it: the current query answers from
 *      the existing snapshot and the next one sees fresh data.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP: each item carries the `owner` of the session it came from, and rows
 * not tied to any live/persisted session (host-wide transcript history) carry
 * `owner: undefined`. `canAccessOwned()` then reproduces the unified route's rule
 * exactly, in multi-user mode a non-admin sees neither other users' sessions nor
 * unowned host-wide history, and in single-user mode every check short-circuits
 * true. The snapshot is written UNSCOPED, so it must never be returned unfiltered.
 *
 * Key exports:
 * - setHistorySessionIndex / getHistorySessionIndex: the snapshot accessors.
 * - buildHistorySessionIndexItems: pure merged-list → index-item projection.
 * - setHistoryIndexRefresher / ensureHistorySessionIndexFresh: the refresh hook.
