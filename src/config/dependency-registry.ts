 * DeepSeek rows, so `codeman doctor` stopped reporting two shipped CLIs at all. Deriving
 * the list makes that class of omission impossible.
 *
 * ⚠️ The version regex is compiled through `compileVersionRegex()`, NOT `new RegExp()`. It
 * is a config-supplied pattern, so it goes through the same length cap and
 * nested-quantifier rejection the argv engine applies; the doctor runs it over command
 * output exactly like the resolver does, and skipping the guard here would leave one
 * unguarded path into a user-supplied regex.
 *
 * ⚠️ Sharing the entry's regex with the resolver is what stops the doctor and the run mode
 * telling the user opposite things about the same binary — the Dependencies panel reporting
 * "Pi CLI ✓" on a box where Run Pi stays hidden.
