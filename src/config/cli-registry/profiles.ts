/**
 * @fileoverview The NAMES of code profiles a `CliEntry` field may select, and the helpers
 * that validate them.
 *
 * A profile is the escape hatch for behaviour that is genuinely code-shaped and cannot be
 * expressed as data — codex's predictive write-through echo, deepseek's profile-launcher
 * runnability check, deepseek's status bridge — without letting any of that code branch on
 * a CLI's id. A registry field names a profile; the implementation lives beside whatever it
 * needs, and looks its name up here.
 *
 * ⚠️ This module is PURE and must stay that way: names, types and predicates only, no
 * imports outside this directory. The implementations pull in resolvers and the status
 * shim, which in turn reach back into the registry, so holding them here would close an
 * import cycle (profiles → deepseek-cli-resolver → cli-resolver → registry → schema →
 * profiles). Keeping the names here and the implementations at their call sites is what
 * lets `schema.ts` validate a profile name at LOAD time — a custom entry naming a profile
 * this build does not implement fails loudly instead of silently failing closed later.
 *
 * The rule all of this enforces: `test/cli-registry-no-id-branching.test.ts` fails on any
 * `mode === '<stock id>'` comparison outside `stock.ts`, so a NEW behavioural special case
 * must be added here, named, and referenced from a registry field — never inlined as an id
 * check at the call site.
 *
 * ⚠️ A profile is a LAST resort, not a convenience. Reach for one only when the behaviour
 * needs to run code (a side effect, a computed value, a probe); anything that is a list, a
 * flag, or a string belongs in the entry as data, where a custom CLI can also use it.
 *
