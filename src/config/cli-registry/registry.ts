/**
 * @fileoverview Loads, merges and re-validates the CLI registry.
 *
 * `~/.codeman/clis.json` holds OVERRIDES and CUSTOM entries only — never a full copy of the
 * stock catalog — so a shipped fix to a stock definition actually reaches an existing
 * install, and the file stays small enough to hand-edit.
 *
 * Resolution: start from `STOCK_CLIS` → deep-merge each override by id (objects merge
 * key-wise, arrays replace wholesale) → validate every resulting entry. A stock entry that
 * fails validation after merge falls back to its pristine stock definition (a fat-fingered
 * override cannot brick a shipped CLI); a custom entry that fails is dropped with a warning
 * rather than failing the whole load. Stock entries are always emitted, so `shell` and
 * `claude` can be disabled but can never go missing — large parts of the app assume at
 * minimum that a shell fallback exists.
 *
 * ⚠️ READ-ONLY. Nothing in this module writes, creates or migrates the file. That is a
 * deliberate property, not a missing feature: there is no settings UI and no write API yet,
 * so there is nothing to persist, and it means importing the registry — which
 * `src/web/schemas.ts` does, transitively, just to validate a request — performs no
 * filesystem writes. A `seededStockIds` ratchet belongs with the write API that needs it.
 * The one exception is the quarantine RENAME of a file that fails to parse (see
 * `readRegistryFile`), which happens on first use rather than at import.
 *
 * ⚠️ The file must be mode 0600. `isUnsafePermissions` refuses ANY group/world bit, read
 * bits included, so a file created with a normal umask (0644) is ignored. Every reason the
 * file was ignored, or an entry in it dropped, is logged ONCE on first load: the warnings
 * used to be returned to a caller that nobody wired up, so a normally-created file was
 * ignored with no feedback anywhere (found reviewing #347).
