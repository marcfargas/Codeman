# xterm-zerolag-input

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Mobile catches up: links open from a tap, terminal text can be selected and copied, long prompts stay visible while you type. Plus Files panel search, a bundled Nerd Font symbols fallback, and a per-device terminal font setting.
  - **Terminal and chat links work on phones** (#321): tapping a URL or file path in terminal output now opens it (new tab, file preview, or log viewer), resolved through the same provider desktop hover uses, so tap and click can never disagree about what is a link. Dialog rows and the composer keep their existing meaning. Response-viewer links open in a new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"` instead of navigating the dashboard away. Wrapped links open whole: the logical-line reconstruction now stitches hard wraps through the indent their continuation carries, which also fixes desktop hover-click truncating wrapped URLs.
  - **Terminal text can be copied on touch devices** (#321): long-press selects the token under the finger, drag or tap the other end to extend, and a small bar offers Copy, Line (the whole logical line, wraps included) and dismiss. Copy works on plain-HTTP installs too. Three guards keep the keyboard down and the selection alive through the browser's own long-press handling.
  - **A long prompt stays visible on phones** (#321): the local-echo overlay grows upward once it would run past the last visible row (a prompt taller than the screen keeps its tail, where the cursor is), and the keyboard-driven padding shrink can no longer reclaim the space the fixed toolbar and accessory bar stand in.
  - **Files panel search** (#324): `GET /api/sessions/:id/files?q=...` answers a flat match list (name or path substring, `*`/`?` globs), recursing past non-matching directories with its own match cap on top of the existing bounds; without `q` the response is byte-identical to before. Glob queries are matched without regex so a pathological pattern cannot stall the server.
  - **Nerd Font prompt glyphs out of the box, custom terminal font** (#320): a bundled icons-only Symbols Nerd Font Mono fallback renders powerlevel10k/starship/oh-my-posh glyphs on every device with no font install, and App Settings gains a per-device terminal font family that is prepended to the built-in stack.

### Minor Changes

- 55bff4a: Zero-lag predictive echo for Codex sessions (mosh-style write-through prediction).

  Codex's per-keystroke composer forced 1.12.2 to disable the local-echo overlay (issues #218/#219/#220/#222), leaving Codex typing at full round-trip latency on remote links. This release adds a second echo mode instead of re-enabling the first: every keystroke still goes to the PTY exactly as before (byte-identical wire behavior, pinned by vm-level and end-to-end trace-equality tests), while the new `PredictiveEchoAddon` in `xterm-zerolag-input` 0.2.0 paints the predicted glyph at the predicted cell. When the real echo lands, the prediction is confirmed and its span removed (an invisible swap); mispredictions self-heal via a two-pass mismatch cascade and a TTL.
  - Reconciliation reads the parsed terminal buffer, never the raw stream: full-line redraws, ECH gap painting and tmux's in-place deltas all converge to the same cells. Confirmation requires the cell match PLUS a cursor advance, so placeholder glyphs and identical repaints never false-confirm; blank cells are neutral (codex clears its placeholder on the first echo).
  - Predictions paint only while the cursor sits on the measured Codex composer row (`/^› /`, codex-cli 0.147): trust/approval modals and wrapped continuation rows get no ghosts, deliberately falling back to real echo.
  - Ships as a SEPARATE `vendor/xterm-predictive-echo.js` bundle: the existing zerolag bundle is byte-identical (sha256-verified), and a missing or broken bundle degrades Codex to exact 1.12.2 behavior. The per-device `localEchoEnabled` toggle is the kill switch.
  - Claude/Gemini/OpenCode/Antigravity keep buffer mode untouched; shell stays off.
  - A post-build adversarial review added the anchor-hold rule: after an unpredicted wire edit (backspace into echoed text, cleared input, IME text commits) new predictions hold until the next parsed write, so a stale displayed cursor can never mis-anchor a run.
  - Tests: 55 new package tests including replay suites driven by fixtures recorded from a real codex TUI through the production tmux+strip pipeline (`scripts/dev/record-codex-frames.mjs`) and a 500-iteration seeded fuzz; new vm policy/wire-neutrality suites; a 10-scenario Playwright E2E against real codex covering the #218/#219/#220/#222 retests, byte-identity, and a simulated 300ms-RTT run. The package test suite now runs in CI.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- **New addon: `PredictiveEchoAddon`, mosh-style write-through prediction.** The second echo mode for per-keystroke TUIs (OpenAI Codex's composer, live pickers) that buffer-until-Enter starves. Every keystroke is sent by the consumer immediately and unchanged; the addon paints the predicted glyph at the predicted cell and reconciles against the PARSED terminal buffer: confirmation requires the cell match plus a cursor advance past the record, foreign non-blank content on two consecutive passes cascades a drop, blank cells are neutral, a TTL bounds everything, and scroll/resize/sustained cursor moves clear the run. Visual-only by construction; it cannot gate, delay or rewrite input.
  - Anchor-hold rule: after an unpredicted wire edit (backspace into echoed text, cleared input, an IME text commit) new predictions hold until the next parsed write, so a stale displayed cursor can never mis-anchor a run (worst case: exactly one unpredicted keystroke).
  - New exports: `PredictiveEchoAddon`, `PredictiveEchoOptions`, `PredictionState`, plus the long-intended `charCellWidth` / `stringCellWidth` helpers.
  - `XtermTerminal` type gains OPTIONAL members (`buffer.active.cursorX/cursorY`, `getLine().getCell?`, `onWriteParsed?`, `onResize?`). Additive only: existing consumers and mocks are unaffected.
  - IIFE build exposes `window.PredictiveEchoAddon` and a self-activating `window.PredictiveEchoOverlay`, alongside the unchanged `ZerolagInputAddon` / `LocalEchoOverlay` globals.
  - Tests: 52 new (30 addon-law specs, renderer geometry, 6 replay suites driven by fixtures recorded from real codex 0.147 through tmux + the production strip, and a 500-iteration seeded fuzz with per-op invariants). `@xterm/headless` as a devDependency; runtime dependencies remain zero.

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- **Fixed: sessions failed to start on macOS with `Error: posix_spawnp failed.`** (issues #6 and #204)

  `node-pty@1.1.0` publishes its macOS prebuilt helper as `prebuilds/darwin-<arch>/spawn-helper` with mode 0644, i.e. no execute bit. macOS launches every PTY through that helper, so a stock install failed on every session start. The bug is macOS-only: `spawn-helper` is a mac-only gyp target and node-pty ships no Linux prebuild, so Linux always compiles a correctly-permissioned helper from source.

  The previous fix chmodded only `build/Release/spawn-helper`, which on macOS does not exist (the prebuild is used, so node-gyp never runs), and it derived that path from `require.resolve('node-pty')`, landing on `<pkg>/lib/build/Release/...`. It was a no-op on every platform.
  - New `scripts/fix-node-pty.mjs` (also `npm run fix:node-pty`) chmods every `spawn-helper` it finds, in `build/Release`, `build/Debug` and each `prebuilds/*/`, then verifies the result by actually opening a PTY. A `require()` alone passes on a broken install, because the helper is only touched at spawn time.
  - `postinstall` no longer force-rebuilds node-pty from source on Node 22+. That step needed Xcode command line tools, cost 30-120s on every install, and deleted the `prebuilds/` tree before compiling, so a Mac without a compiler was left with no working binary at all. A rebuild now happens only when the chmod plus spawn probe still fails, and the prebuilds tree is backed up and restored around it.
  - New `spawnPtyWithHelperRepair()` (`src/utils/node-pty-repair.ts`) wraps every `pty.spawn()` in `session.ts`, so an install that is already broken repairs itself on the first failed spawn and retries in-process instead of showing a dead session. Unrelated spawn errors are rethrown untouched; a second failure carries the `npm run fix:node-pty` hint.
  - `scripts/fix-node-pty.mjs` is now in the published `files` list, so global npm installs get the repair too.
  - Direct-PTY Claude spawns use the resolved absolute binary path (new `getClaudeBinaryPath()`) instead of the bare name `claude`, so a CLI installed outside the server's PATH still launches.

  Verified end to end on macOS 26.4 arm64: a stock `npm i` reproduces `posix_spawnp failed.`, and after the fix the same install spawns a PTY successfully with the prebuilds preserved.

  **Added: phone home screen (session overview)**

  Under 430px the "C" logo now opens a session overview (current sessions, past sessions, spaces) instead of the welcome overlay: on a small screen "which session needs me" beats "how do I start one". Rows resume a session in place, and "New session here" goes through the normal quick-start path so remote and Docker cases keep their routing. Per-device setting `mobileOverviewEnabled` (phones only, default ON) in App Settings. Tablet and desktop are unchanged.

  **Added: guided Tailscale setup in `install.sh`**

  The network-access prompt is now 3-way: Tailscale, LAN, or local-only. The Tailscale path binds loopback and walks through installing Tailscale, logging in, the operator grant, the tailnet HTTPS-certificates toggle, and `tailscale serve --bg <port>`, then verifies the result end to end with curl. That gives HTTPS on a real certificate with no app password and no `0.0.0.0` bind, which is also what PWA install and web push need. `install.sh tailscale` retrofits it onto an existing install, and `CODEMAN_TAILSCALE=1` presets the choice. Serve state is detected from `tailscale serve status --json`; the installer never runs `tailscale serve reset` and never touches serve mappings other than 443 to Codeman's port. README and `docs/security-architecture.md` updated to match.

  **Docs**: replaced a real tailnet hostname with placeholders in `docs/web-tabs-fixes-plan.md`.

  **xterm-zerolag-input**: npm description and keywords only, no code change.

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- Fix a latent bug where a partial settings PUT silently reset live service state, and trim the `xterm-zerolag-input` README callout.
  - **`PUT /api/settings` no longer resets watchers on a partial body.** The three `toggleService` calls (subagent watcher, workflow-run watcher, image watcher) read the raw request body with `??` defaults, so every key a caller omitted was treated as "apply the default". A body of just `{statusLineTelemetry:true}` would START the subagent watcher and STOP the workflow and image watchers, undoing the persisted config. They now resolve from `merged` (persisted settings + incoming), the same convention the `tmuxHistoryLimit` branch in that handler already used, so any PUT reconciles services to the effective stored state. Nothing triggered this in practice because every shipped client sends a full settings payload rebuilt from the DOM, but it was a trap for the next partial-update caller.
  - **Regression test**: `test/routes/system-routes-settings-partial-put.test.ts` (4 cases) pins both directions, omitted keys preserve state and explicit keys still take effect. Verified to fail against the pre-fix handler.
  - **CLAUDE.md** records the rule under "Adding Features → App setting": anything acting on a setting in that handler must resolve from `merged`, never the request body.
  - **`xterm-zerolag-input` README**: removed the links line (getcodeman.com / install one-liner / star link) from the Codeman callout above the demo GIF. The callout keeps its links in the heading and body.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- Plan-usage chip now defaults ON on desktop, plus the reworked `xterm-zerolag-input` README.
  - **Plan-usage chip defaults ON (desktop).** The `showPlanUsageLimits` chip (live 5-hour and weekly plan usage from the Claude statusline) used to be opt-in and default OFF, so most users never saw it. Desktop now defaults ON; handhelds still default OFF so the phone header stays minimal and the `mobile-header-buttons-policy` guard keeps passing. Devices with an explicitly stored preference keep whatever they chose, so nobody's OFF gets overridden.
  - **One resolver behind the chip.** Added `planUsageChipEnabled()` in settings-ui.js and routed all three call sites through it: the App Settings checkbox, the chip's visibility, and the create-time `statusLineTelemetry` flag in session-ui.js. Those three had independent `?? false` / `=== true` defaults, and a chip revealed without the telemetry flag renders `—` forever, so a default flip on one site alone would have shipped a permanently empty chip.
  - **Cron button comment corrected.** The App Settings comment claimed "Cron button defaults ON" while the code, the template (`btn-cron--hidden`) and the CSS all default it OFF. Verified against a fresh browser profile: the button is hidden and its checkbox unchecked out of the box. Comment now matches, and states why the two halves stay consistent.
  - **Docs.** CLAUDE.md, `docs/architecture-invariants.md` and `docs/usage-limits-display-plan.md` updated for the new default and the single-resolver rule; the stale `styles.css` comment claiming the server strips the chip's hidden class at render was corrected (display is per-device, so the client reveals it).
  - **`xterm-zerolag-input` README rework** (0.1.5 shipped the content; this republishes with the graphic and promo changes): replaced the misaligned 8-line keystroke-flow diagram with a two-line stock-vs-zerolag contrast, added a Codeman callout above the demo GIF with links to getcodeman.com and the repo, and rewrote the Origin section so it argues the extraction story instead of repeating the promo.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Rewrite the `xterm-zerolag-input` package README as a value-first document and correct the drift that had accumulated against the source.
  - Added the side-by-side phone demo GIF (`docs/images/zerolag-demo-20260728.gif`) as the hero image, referenced by absolute raw URL so it renders on npmjs.com as well as GitHub. The two-phone comparison shows 0ms local echo next to a 600ms-2.7s server echo on the same session.
  - New "Why this one" comparison table, an explicit list of target use cases (SSH web clients, cloud IDEs, mobile terminals, container consoles), and a bundle-size badge (6.1 kB gzipped, measured from the ESM build).
  - Corrected the test-count badge from 78 to the actual 175 tests across 5 files, in both the package README and the Published Packages section of the root README.
  - Removed the stale "Unicode/emoji rendered at single-cell width" limitation. CJK, fullwidth forms and emoji have had double-width rendering and visual-column positioning since the wide-character fix; the honest remaining caveat (per-code-point width summing over-counts ZWJ grapheme clusters) replaces it.
  - Documented the previously undocumented public `setPrompt()` method for switching prompt strategies at runtime, and the new "Wide characters (CJK, emoji)" integration section covering the optional `Unicode11Addon` path and the built-in range-table fallback.
  - Documented `backgroundColor: 'transparent'`, corrected the `foregroundColor` default, and updated the grid-alignment math to reflect visual-column positioning rather than character index.

  No source changes, docs only.
