# Feature brief: Session tab detach / undock (for Codeman)

> ✅ **SHIPPED — on GitHub as PR #103 (open).** Branch `beta/session-detach` on
> `Ark0N/Codeman` (base `master`): "feat(web): session detach/undock + beta
> instance isolation (port 5000)", containing detach/undock + instance isolation
> + the base gesture overlay (commit `afea6d6`). `app.detachSession(id)` in
> `app.js` opens `/session/:id` as a solo window (another live client of the same
> session), tracks it (badge + `BroadcastChannel` sync + re-dock on close), and is
> the single idempotent entry point both the on-tab ⧉ icon and the gesture layer
> call. PTY fan-out (the open question below) resolved **yes**, so no streaming
> work was needed. CI green after I fixed a prettier format:check on `auth.ts`
> (commit `ceca853`).

## Goal

Let a session "tab" pop out of the main dashboard into its **own browser
window** (and back). Each detached window shows just that one session's
terminal, fully live. This is a standalone UX win *and* a prerequisite for
gesture control later (a hand-gesture "drop" will eventually trigger
detach/relocate — but that's a separate project; **this feature is plain UI
buttons only**).

## Core approach (refine as needed)

- Add a **"Detach" control** on each tab. It opens a new browser window
  (`window.open`) pointing at a **single-session view** — ideally a real route
  like `/session/:id` so the popup just loads a URL and attaches like a normal
  client.
- The detached window runs its **own xterm.js instance connected to the same
  session's WebSocket**, so it's live, not a screenshot.
- Keep the dashboard and detached windows **in sync** (session list, titles,
  alive/dead state, focus) — via the existing events channel, or a
  `BroadcastChannel` if simpler.
- Support **re-dock** (close popup → tab returns to the dashboard) and handle the
  popup being closed/refreshed gracefully.

## The one critical question to resolve first (in Codeman's own code)

Can the server currently **fan out one session's PTY/tmux output to multiple
concurrent WebSocket clients**, or is it single-consumer? A detached window is a
*second* viewer of the same session. If it's single-consumer today, that's the
main change: make the pty→socket stream **broadcast to N subscribers** (and merge
input) so dashboard + popup can both watch/type. This likely matters more than
the UI work.

## Other decisions for Codeman

- Per-session route (`/session/:id`) vs. a single-page popup that's told which id
  to show.
- Multi-monitor placement later via the Window Management API
  (`getScreenDetails`) — **out of scope now**, just don't design against it.
- Auth/cookie sharing so a popup window authenticates the same as the dashboard.

## Constraints

- Implement on a **beta branch**, not `main`.
- The gesture-control side keeps a **read-only** copy of Codeman (its `.git`
  removed); the live `Ark0N/Codeman` repo is **not** touched from here. Codeman
  implements this itself.

## Why this is sequenced before gesture wiring

Gestures can only drag DOM **within the single page that owns the camera**; you
cannot drag a node across isolated browser tabs / OS windows. So undock must be a
**Codeman session-placement operation** that a gesture `drop` later *triggers* —
not something the gesture layer does. Detach first; wire gestures to it after.
