# The Dashboard

What the interface is telling you, and which parts of it are hidden until you turn them on.

Most of Codeman's UI is **opt-in**. A stock install shows a deliberately small header, and a
feature you read about here may simply not be on screen yet. Where that is the case, this
page says so and names the setting.

## Layout

| Region             | What lives there                                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Header, left**   | The "C" logo (goes home) and the session list, unless you moved it to the sidebar.       |
| **Header, right**  | Status chips and panel buttons, most of them off by default.                            |
| **Center**         | The terminal for the active session, or the home screen when nothing is selected.        |
| **Bottom toolbar** | Run, Stop, Run Shell, the case picker, and the instance counters.                        |
| **Overlays**       | Panels and modals: Respawn, Cron, Subagents, File Viewer, Settings.                      |

## Session list layout

The session list lives in the header as a horizontal strip by default. With a lot of
sessions open that strip stops being scannable, so **App Settings → Appearance → Tabs →
Session List Layout** can move it into a vertical sidebar on the left instead.

| Layout               | Behaviour                                                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Header tab strip** | The default. Wraps to a second row on desktop, scrolls sideways on a phone.        |
| **Left sidebar**     | A vertical list with a filter box and a live session count. `Alt+B` collapses it to a narrow rail that keeps the status dots and task badges visible. On a phone it is an off-canvas drawer rather than a docked rail. |

It is the same list either way, just re-hosted: tab order, drag-to-reorder, the `Alt+1`
to `Alt+9` numbers and every status colour below behave identically in both. The setting is
per device, so a sidebar on your desktop does not force one onto your phone.

## Session tabs

One tab per session, in your order, and that order syncs across your devices.

**Status is carried by the dot and the tab's own styling:**

| Look                          | Meaning                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Green dot                     | Alive, not currently working.                                            |
| Pulsing green dot with a ring | Working on a turn.                                                       |
| Yellow tab, blinking          | The agent is waiting for input from you.                                 |
| Red tab, blinking             | A question or permission prompt is blocking the session.                 |
| No dot                        | The session is not running.                                              |

![Tab alerts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ark0N/Codeman/master/docs/images/tab-alerts-20260815.png)

The alert states are steady colour with a pulse layered on top, not a blink between the
alert colour and nothing, so a tab that needs you looks like it needs you at every point in
the cycle. They survive a page reload: the state is re-seeded from the server on load, so
reloading while a permission prompt is blocking does not lose the red tab.

**Navigation:**

| Action                          | Keys                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Jump to tab N                   | `Alt+1` to `Alt+9` (the number on the tab)              |
| Next / previous                 | `Ctrl+Tab`, `Alt+[`, `Alt+]`                            |
| Move the active tab             | `Ctrl+Shift+{`, `Ctrl+Shift+}`                          |
| Close                           | `Ctrl+W`                                                |
| Find any session, open or past  | `Ctrl+K` (also `Cmd+K` and `Alt+K`)                     |

Tabs can also be dragged to reorder.

On phones the strip scrolls horizontally instead of wrapping, and the active tab is always
scrolled into view. It is not reordered to the front, so the `Alt+N` numbering stays stable.

### Lineage arcs

When one session spawns another (an agent starting a worker through the API), Codeman draws
a coloured arc under the strip connecting parent to child, with one colour per child. It is
how a fan-out of eight workers stays readable.

Desktop only, and on by default. Turn it off in **App Settings → Appearance**. Arcs are
skipped for tabs scrolled out of the strip.

## Header controls

The right side of the header. Almost all of these are off until you enable them in
**App Settings → Header & Panels**.

| Control                | Default            | What it does                                                                    |

New header controls never appear on phones. Phone layout is deliberately minimal and is
covered in [Mobile Guide](Mobile-Guide).

## Connection state

The dot in the header is the quick read. Two louder surfaces exist because a cached page
with no server behind it used to look identical to a page with no sessions:

- **A full-screen overlay** when the page has never loaded server state. There is nothing
  behind it worth preserving.
- **A banner** when the connection drops after state had loaded, so your scrollback stays
  readable.

Both wait about 2.5 seconds before appearing, so a deploy that restarts the server does not
flash a warning at you every time. If the browser reports itself offline, the grace period
is skipped.

There is also a watchdog for the case where the connection stops delivering without
erroring. If the server's heartbeat stops arriving, Codeman reconnects on its own rather
than sitting on a green dot showing frozen data.

## The terminal

A real terminal: xterm.js in the browser, a real PTY on the server, tmux in between. Full
TUIs render correctly.

Worth knowing:

- **Scrollback.** Agent/TUI sessions pull their entire tmux scrollback on first open.
  Shell sessions open from a bounded recent tail so a large transcript cannot stall tab
  switching; press **Load full history** to pull the rest explicitly. Ordinary Shell scrolling
  and automatic output recovery stay within the bounded browser buffer.
- **Wheel and touch scrolling** are forwarded into Claude's own transcript on recent Claude
  versions, so the wheel scrolls the conversation rather than the terminal. `Shift+Wheel` is
  always local scrollback. Other CLIs scroll locally.
- **Selection copy.** `Ctrl+C` copies when text is selected and interrupts when it is not.
  `Ctrl+Shift+C` always copies.
- **Zero-lag input.** On touch devices, keystrokes paint locally before the round trip. See
  [Input And Voice](Input-And-Voice).
- **Renderer.** WebGL by default, with a watchdog that falls back to DOM rendering if the
  GPU stalls. `?nowebgl` forces DOM rendering for one page load.

## The home screen

With no session selected you get the welcome screen: run buttons for the CLIs Codeman
found, a QR code when a password is set, cross-session search, and **Resume Conversation**,
which lists past sessions including Claude conversations started outside Codeman entirely.

Two extras depending on the device:

- **Desktop, wide windows**: your open tabs appear as a rail docked to the left edge, in tab
  order, with created and last-active stamps. It needs at least 1180px of width; below that
  it is hidden so it cannot overlap the search panel.
- **Phones**: tapping the "C" logo gives a session overview instead: NEEDS YOU first, then
  current sessions, then past ones. On by default.

Session-specific configuration lives in **Session Options**, reachable from the tab. App
Settings is global; Session Options is per session.

## Search and the session palette

`Ctrl+K` opens the session palette: every session, live or historical, filtered as you
type. Picking a past one resumes its conversation.

The search box on the home screen is wider in scope. It federates over session metadata,
run-summary events, and attachment history, filtered by type, case, status, and date. It
does substring matching over data already in memory, with no regex and no filesystem reads,
so it is fast and cannot be turned into a traversal.

## Appearance

**App Settings → Appearance** carries the theme skins, including light ones. The choice is
applied before the first paint, so there is no flash of the wrong theme on load.

The same section has the entrance animations for tabs, terminals, agent windows, and
lineage lines. All of them default to the legacy no-animation behaviour, so an untouched
install animates nothing.
