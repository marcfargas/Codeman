# Watching Agents Work

Modern agents fan out. A single Claude session can be running six subagents, and the parent
terminal shows you almost none of it. Codeman surfaces that hidden work as live windows,
panels, and after-the-fact summaries.

Everything on this page is Claude-only. It reads Claude Code's transcripts and team state;
the other CLIs expose no equivalent.

## Subagent windows

When a Claude session spawns subagents, each one gets its own floating window with a live
transcript: what it was asked to do, what it is doing, and what it returned.

- Windows are draggable and resizable, and their positions persist across reloads.
- A connection line links each window to the session tab that spawned it, so with four
  sessions running you can still tell whose worker is whose.
- Closing a window does not stop the subagent. It only stops you watching it.

This is the feature that makes a fan-out legible. Without it, a lead session that spawned
eight workers looks like a stalled terminal for several minutes.

## Session lineage arcs

The tab strip draws a coloured arc from a parent tab to any tab it spawned, one colour per
child. That covers the other direction of fan-out: not subagents inside one session, but
whole sessions started by an agent through the API.

Desktop only, on by default, and toggled in **App Settings → Appearance**. Arcs are skipped
for tabs scrolled out of view.

See [Driving Codeman From An Agent](Driving-Codeman-From-An-Agent) for the spawning side.

## Agent teams

Claude Code's experimental agent teams appear as teammates alongside subagents. Enable them
in the CLI's own environment:

```bash
CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
```

and turn the per-case **Agent Teams** toggle on in the case settings gear.

Codeman watches the team directory and matches teammates to the session leading them.
Teammates are in-process threads rather than separate CLI processes, so they show up as
windows, not tabs.

Notes and the experiment log:
[`docs/agent-teams/`](https://github.com/Ark0N/Codeman/tree/master/docs/agent-teams).

## Ultracode and workflow runs

When Claude runs a Workflow, dozens of agents can be in flight at once. The completion
artifact for a run is only written at the **end**, so a live run would otherwise be
invisible until it finished. Codeman synthesizes the in-flight view from the transcripts and
lets the real artifact supersede it when it lands.

Two independent toggles, both off by default:

| Setting                | Shows                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Ultracode panel        | A docked panel listing the run's agents.  |
| Ultracode windows      | Floating windows, like subagents.         |

Turning on either starts the watcher.

## Reading the answer, not the terminal

**Last Response** (header button, opt-in) renders the agent's last answer as scrollable text
rather than terminal output. It exists mostly for phones, where reading a long answer in a
terminal viewport is painful. **More** loads additional context.

## After the fact

| Surface            | Answers                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Away Digest**    | What happened while I was gone?                                 |
| **Run summary**    | What did this run actually do?                                   |
| **Lifecycle log**  | When did sessions start, exit, or get killed, and why?           |
| **Token stats**    | What did it cost?                                                |

The Away Digest aggregates the lifecycle log, run summary events, live sessions, token
statistics, and recent subagents into one view. It is the right first thing to open in the
morning after an overnight run.

All of these header buttons are opt-in: **App Settings → Header & Panels**.

## Performance

The design target is 20 sessions and 50 agent windows at 60fps. If you routinely run more
than that, expect the browser rather than the server to be the limit, and close windows you
are not reading.

## Gotchas

- **A session pointed at a relocated Claude config directory goes blind here.** Transcripts
  written outside `~/.claude/projects` are invisible to the watchers, so subagent windows,
  the ultracode panel, the response viewer, and Read My Mind all stop working for that
  session. Symlink `projects` back into the shared tree to fix it. See
  [Agent CLIs](Agent-CLIs).
- **Closing a window does not cancel the agent.** Nothing on this page controls agents; it
  observes them.
- **Windows are opt-in for ultracode, automatic for subagents.**
