# Agent CLIs

Codeman drives seven run modes: six agent CLIs plus a plain shell. This page covers picking
one, setting it up, and the differences that actually change how you work.

## The seven modes

| Mode                 | CLI                          | Get it                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude Code**      | `claude`                     | [docs.anthropic.com](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)   |
| **OpenCode**         | `opencode`                   | [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai)                                     |
| **Codex**            | `codex`                      | [developers.openai.com/codex/cli](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) |
| **Gemini**           | `gemini`                     | [github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) |
| **Antigravity**      | `agy`                        | [antigravity.google](https://antigravity.google)                       |
| **Pi**               | `pi`                         | [pi.dev](https://pi.dev)                                               |
| **Terminal / Shell** | your `$SHELL`                | Already installed.                                                     |

Any combination works, including all of them. The run mode is chosen per session from the
arrow beside the **Run** button, so one case can have a Claude session and a Codex session
open side by side.

## Codeman does not manage your logins

Install each CLI yourself and log it in once by hand. Codeman never collects, stores, or
refreshes your CLI credentials. It launches the binary and attaches to the result.

The one place credentials are touched is [Docker Cases](Docker-Cases), where host
credentials are copied into a container read-only at launch so you do not have to log in
again inside it. Even there, the container keeps its own copies and never writes back to
your host credential stores.

## Making a CLI visible to Codeman

Codeman resolves each binary from the environment the **server** runs in, which is not
necessarily the shell you tested in.

```bash
codeman doctor          # what Codeman can actually see
codeman doctor --json
```

If a CLI is installed but a Run button for it never appears:

1. Check `which <cli>` in a plain login shell, not just your interactive one.
2. If Codeman runs as a service, remember that launchd hands a job
   `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`. `codeman service install` bakes your PATH into the unit
   precisely to avoid this; a hand-written plist or unit will not.
3. Restart the server after installing a new CLI.

`pi` is additionally version-probed rather than trusted by name, because `pi` is a generic
enough command that something else on your PATH may answer to it.

## Claude is the reference mode

A number of Codeman features exist only for Claude sessions. This is structural, not a
backlog: they depend on Claude Code's hook system, or on parsing Claude's specific terminal
output. The other CLIs expose no equivalent.

| Feature                                          | Claude | Other CLIs                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Sessions, tabs, scrollback, exactly-once input    | Yes    | Yes                                                  |
| Respawn cycling and unattended runs               | Yes    | Yes                                                  |

| Docker cases, remote SSH cases                    | Yes    | Yes                                                  |
| Precise idle detection (hook-driven)              | Yes    | Output-stabilization fallback, coarser                |
| Auto-resume when a usage limit resets             | Yes    | No                                                   |
| Plan usage chip                                   | Yes    | No                                                   |
| Approvals Inbox                                   | Yes    | No                                                   |
| Read My Mind                                      | Yes    | No                                                   |
| Ralph loop and its task tracker                   | Yes    | No                                                   |
| Subagent and team windows                         | Yes    | No                                                   |
| Model, effort, and ultracode controls             | Yes    | No                                                   |
| `stop` and `blocked` wait signals                 | Yes    | 400 if you ask for them explicitly                   |
| The bundled agent skill                           | Yes    | No                                                   |

Everything that makes a session a session works everywhere. What is Claude-only is mostly
the machinery that needs to know *what* the agent is doing rather than *that* it is doing
something.

## Per-CLI notes

### Claude Code

The defaults you will care about, all under **App Settings**:

- **Model** (Models section). Written into the case's `.claude/settings.local.json` as a
  soft default, so `/model` still works mid-session. The 1M-context Opus variant is a
  switch on the model card rather than a separate model.
- **Effort** (`low` through `max`) or **ultracode** for dynamic multi-agent workflows. Also
  a soft default: `/effort` overrides it any time. Effort is deliberately not passed as an
  environment variable, because that would hard-lock it and block in-session switching.
- **Startup permission mode** (Agents & CLIs section). The default is
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, which is why the security model matters. You can switch
  new sessions to Anthropic's classifier-guarded `auto` mode, normal prompting, or an
  explicit allowed-tools list.

**Separate Claude accounts per session.** Set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in a session's environment
overrides to point it at a different Claude config directory, which is how you run one
session on a client's subscription and another on your own. One caveat: a relocated config
directory writes transcripts outside `~/.claude/projects`, which blinds the response viewer,
subagent windows, ultracode panel, and Read My Mind for that session. Symlink `projects`
back into the shared tree to keep them working:

```bash
ln -s ~/.claude/projects <configDir>/projects
```

### OpenCode

Renders its own TUI, so Codeman treats readiness as output stabilization rather than
watching for a prompt marker. Requires tmux, with no direct-PTY fallback, because its
environment is injected through socket-scoped `tmux setenv` rather than the command line.

Integration detail: [`docs/opencode-integration.md`](https://github.com/Ark0N/Codeman/blob/master/docs/opencode-integration.md).

### Codex

Two behaviours that are deliberate and worth knowing:

- **Predictive echo instead of buffered echo.** Codex's composer reacts to every keystroke,
  a `/` opens a live-filtering picker, arrows edit server-side state. Buffering keystrokes
  until Enter starved it, so Codex paints each keystroke at the predicted cell while the
  bytes on the wire stay byte-identical to what you typed.
- **The wheel is not forwarded** into its transcript. Codex ignores the mouse reports
  Codeman would send, so forwarding produced a dead wheel. Scrolling in a Codex session is
  local scrollback.

### Gemini

Enterprise only, since Google's June 2026 consumer cutover. Its environment allowlist
includes the broad `GOOGLE_*` namespace, deliberately, because Vertex AI authentication
needs `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, and
`GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`. That is the loosest allowlist entry in Codeman and it affects
only the CLI you spawned yourself.

### Antigravity

Google's successor to the consumer Gemini CLI, invoked as `agy`. It keeps all of its state
in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/`, so the credential handling that applies to Gemini applies
to it as well.

### Pi

Pi needs the opposite instincts from every other CLI here.

- **It has no permission prompts and no sandbox.** There is no bypass flag to send, and
  Codeman does not invent one.
- **Its privileged setting is project trust**, a three-way `--approve` / `--no-approve` /
  unset. Approving trust makes Pi **execute repo-local `.pi/extensions` TypeScript**, so
  point it at a repository you trust. In multi-user mode, a user without an explicit grant
  gets `--no-approve` even when no configuration exists.
- **Authentication is `/login` inside the session**, or the server process's own
  environment. Pi's roughly 34 provider keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
  `HF_TOKEN`, and so on) share no common prefix, and the environment allowlist is global
  rather than per mode, so admitting them for Pi would widen the allowlist for every mode at
  once. They stay out.

Guide: [`docs/pi-integration.md`](https://github.com/Ark0N/Codeman/blob/master/docs/pi-integration.md).

### Terminal / Shell

A plain shell in a tmux session. No agent, no hooks, no idle detection.

On phones a shell session automatically swaps the keyboard accessory bar for terminal
controls: Ctrl, Esc, Tab, arrows, paste. **Ctrl is a one-shot modifier**: tap it, then tap a
letter, and the control byte is sent. It disarms on use, on a second tap, on any other
accessory key, on a session switch, and when the keyboard closes. Details in
[Mobile Guide](Mobile-Guide).

## Environment overrides

Per-session environment variables are set when creating a session and persist across
respawns. Which variables are accepted depends on the mode:

| Mode        | Allowed prefixes                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Claude      | `CLAUDE_CODE_*`, plus the exact key `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` |
| OpenCode    | `OPENCODE_*`                      |
| Codex       | `CODEX_*`                         |
| Gemini      | `GEMINI_*`, `GOOGLE_*`            |
| Antigravity | `ANTIGRAVITY_*`                   |
| Pi          | `PI_*`                            |

Anything outside the allowlist is rejected at the schema. This is intentional: the allowlist
is one global list, so widening it for one CLI widens it for all of them.

Two things that deliberately do **not** travel as environment variables: **effort**, because
an environment variable hard-locks it and blocks `/effort`, and **model**, which is written
into the case's `.claude/settings.local.json` so that `/model` keeps working.

## Choosing a mode

- **Claude Code** if you want every Codeman feature. Unattended overnight runs, usage-limit
  auto-resume, the Approvals Inbox, and subagent visualization all assume it.
- **Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, Antigravity** when you prefer that agent or that model. You get
  the session layer, respawn, cron, Docker, and remote SSH; you do not get the hook-driven
  features.
- **Pi** if you want a fast, unsandboxed agent and you understand what project trust does.
- **Shell** for the times you want a terminal on your phone with no agent at all. It is a
  genuinely useful mode, not a fallback.
