# Multi-User Mode

Share one Codeman with a small trusted team. Each person gets their own login and workspace,
and sessions, cases, search, and live events are scoped to their owner.

**Off by default.** Without the flag, behaviour is identical to single-user Codeman, because
every scoping check short-circuits.

## Read this before enabling it

**Multi-user mode separates workspaces. It does not sandbox users from each other.**

Every session still runs as the **same operating system account**. A determined user's agent
can reach another user's files, because at the OS level they are the same user. This is a
convenience and organization feature, not a security boundary.

If you need real isolation:

- Pair each user with [Docker Cases](Docker-Cases), which gives their work its own
  filesystem and network.
- Or run separate Codeman instances under separate OS accounts, each with its own
  `CODEMAN_INSTANCE`.

"Small trusted team" is the honest description of who this is for.

## Enabling it

```bash
codeman users add alice --admin      # create the first admin, prompts for a password
codeman web --multiuser              # or CODEMAN_MULTIUSER=1
```

Then manage users from the CLI or the **Users** entry in App Settings:

```bash
codeman users add bob                # a regular user
codeman users list
codeman users passwd bob             # reset to a one-time password
codeman users rm bob
```

`--password-stdin` reads the password from standard input, for scripts.

Accounts live in `~/.codeman/users.json` with scrypt-hashed passwords, mode 0600.
Administrative actions are audited to `~/.codeman/admin-audit.jsonl`.

## What each user gets

| Thing               | Scope                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Case space**      | `~/codeman-users/<name>/cases`, their own.                                    |
| **Sessions**        | Only theirs are listed, reachable, or controllable.                           |
| **Events**          | Live event routing is per owner, and fails closed.                            |
| **Search**          | Scoped on read, including historical results.                                 |
| **File previews**   | Scoped to sessions they own.                                                  |
| **Path picker**     | Only their own user space as a root, not the whole home directory.            |

Admins see everything.

Ownership threads through every list endpoint, the session lookup helper, the WebSocket
layer, and file previews. A user cannot address another user's session even by id.

## Safer defaults for regular users

Non-admins get tighter defaults, and lifting them is an explicit per-user grant:

| Default                            | Meaning                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Claude runs in `auto` permission mode | Anthropic's classifier-guarded mode instead of skip-prompts.           |
| Raw shell sessions require a grant  | A plain shell is unmediated machine access.                              |
| Skip-permissions requires a grant   | Same reasoning.                                                          |
| Cron `launchCommand` requires a grant | It is an arbitrary command on a schedule.                              |
| Pi project trust defaults to off    | Trust makes Pi execute repo-local TypeScript.                            |

These exist because the OS boundary is shared. They narrow what a normal account can do
casually; they do not make the account a sandbox.

## Accounts and sessions

Each user authenticates with their own name and password rather than the shared
`CODEMAN_PASSWORD`. Logins are individually revocable: disable, reset, or delete an account
at any time, and existing browser sessions can be revoked.

## Gotchas

- **Enabling it does not migrate existing cases** into a user space. They stay where they
  are, owned by whoever the ownership rules resolve them to.
- **Admins see everything**, including other users' sessions. Choose admins accordingly.
- **The audit log is append-only and local.** Ship it somewhere if you care about it.
- **It is not a substitute for OS accounts.** Restating this because it is the one thing
  people get wrong.
