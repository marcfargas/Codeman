# DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) in Codeman

Codeman can run [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)
as a session backend, alongside Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini,
Antigravity, Pi and Grok. It is the ninth run mode, and the one that is wired
least like the others, for two reasons worth understanding before you use it.

## 1. The agent is a profile, not the binary

`dsh` is a **launcher**, not an agent. It boots a *profile*: an ordered stack of
plugin-bundle patch layers under `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<name>` (`$DSH_HOME`
defaults to `~/.dsh`). DeepSeek ships three bundles and none of them is a
terminal agent:

| Profile      | What it is                        | Can Codeman run it in a tab? |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `web`        | the browser UI, served on :3080   | no — but see §6              |
| `headless`   | answers one task and exits        | no                           |
| (`base`)     | the shared core, no app at all    | no                           |

The interactive terminal front door is **always a third-party plugin**. So
"DeepSeek is installed" and "Codeman can start a DeepSeek session" are different
questions, and Codeman answers both separately:

```bash
curl -s localhost:3000/api/deepseek/status | jq
{
  "available": true,            # the `dsh` binary resolved and proved its identity
  "runnable": false,            # ...but nothing installed can drive a pane
  "path": "/home/you/.local/bin",
  "version": "0.1.1-rc.2",
  "dshHome": "/home/you/.dsh",
  "defaultProfile": null,
  "profiles": [ { "name": "web", "kind": "web", "bundles": [...] } ]
}
```

### Installing a terminal profile

From the UI: open the **Run** dropdown. When `dsh` is installed but no
pane-capable profile is, the menu shows **DeepSeek — add a terminal profile…**.
One click installs one and the normal DeepSeek entry appears.

By hand, or to pick a different front door:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile dsh-tui add @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui
```

⚠️ **`pnpm` has to be on PATH for either route.** `dsh plugin` is a thin forwarder
that spawns a literal `pnpm` with no npm fallback, so without one it exits 127 with
`dsh: pnpm not found on PATH` — both by hand and behind the UI button, which
surfaces that same line as the install error. `npm install -g pnpm` (or
`corepack enable pnpm`) is the fix. This is what broke the Docker agent image in
[#352](https://github.com/Ark0N/Codeman/issues/352); the image now installs pnpm
alongside `dsh`.

Codeman's default is `@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui` because it is by a wide
margin the most used community TUI, it is MIT, and it implements the status
contract described in §3. It is a **default, not a requirement**: any profile
under `$DSH_HOME/profiles` that is not `web` or `headless` shows up in the
inventory and can be launched, including one you compose yourself. The endpoint
accepts any npm package name:

```bash
curl -sX POST localhost:3000/api/deepseek/install-profile \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"profile":"my-tui","package":"@someone/dsh-tui"}'
```

Installing a plugin is arbitrary code execution on the host, so in multi-user
mode this endpoint requires the can-bypass-permissions grant (the same bar as a
`shell` session). The request is held open while the package manager runs and is
bounded at five minutes; the install runs in its own process group, so hitting
that bound kills the whole tree rather than just the launcher.

> **`dsh` is also a Debian program.** `apt install dsh` gives you "dancer's
> shell", a distributed shell, which would answer `--version` convincingly.
> Codeman's resolver therefore demands the harness's own help banner before it
> will point a spawn line at a candidate, and `GET /api/deepseek/status` reports
> `path` and `version` so a misresolution is diagnosable rather than presenting
> as "the mode just doesn't work".

## 2. Permissions are an env var, not a flag

The harness has **no `--dangerously-skip-permissions` equivalent**. Its sandbox
and approval rows are configuration, driven by one documented input,
`DSH_PERMISSION_MODE`, with three presets (read off `dsh --dump-default-config`):

| `DSH_PERMISSION_MODE` | sandbox              | approvals | notes                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| `read-only`           | `read-only`          | ask       |                           |
| `workspace-write`     | `workspace-write`    | ask       | the harness's own default |
| `danger-full-access`  | `danger-full-access` | **never** | what the Run button sends |

Codeman exports it via `tmux setenv`, never on the command line. Because the
harness reads it with `??`, it is a **soft default**: it sets the boot-time
preset and you can still change permission mode inside the session.

Omitting it entirely leaves the harness on `workspace-write`, which still asks —
which is why the multi-user clamp only needs to force a *sent* value down. A
non-granted owner's `danger-full-access` becomes `workspace-write`, not
`read-only`: the clamp removes privilege without breaking the session's ability
to edit its own workspace.

Because the switch is an env var rather than a flag, that clamp has a second half
no other CLI needs. `DSH_*` is an allowlisted `envOverrides` prefix (it has to be:
that is also how you set the harness's ordinary knobs), and env overrides are
applied *after* the permission export, so in multi-user mode a non-granted owner
sending

```json
{ "mode": "deepseek", "envOverrides": { "DSH_PERMISSION_MODE": "danger-full-access" } }
```

would otherwise hand back the privilege the config clamp just removed. For a
non-granted owner Codeman therefore **drops `DSH_PERMISSION_MODE` and `DSH_HOME`
from `envOverrides`**; dropping them falls through to the clamped config and the
server's own `DSH_HOME`. `DSH_HOME` is in that list because it points the
launcher at a profile tree, and a profile's plugin code runs at boot, before any
approval row can apply. Single-user installs and granted owners are unaffected.

## 3. Real idle detection (the interesting part)

Every other external CLI mode in Codeman is **readiness-guessed**: Codeman
watches the PTY go quiet and infers that a turn ended. Claude is the exception,
because Claude Code fires hooks.

DeepSeek is the second exception. The community terminal front door already
reports its own lifecycle to a supervising process through a generic,
env-var-gated contract (inherited from [Herdr](https://herdr.dev)): when
`HERDR_ENV=1`, `HERDR_BIN_PATH` and `HERDR_PANE_ID` are set, it shells out on
every state change with

```
"$HERDR_BIN_PATH" pane report-agent "$HERDR_PANE_ID" \
    --source custom:dsh-tui --agent dsh-tui \
    --state idle|working|blocked [--message ...] --seq N
```

Codeman points `HERDR_BIN_PATH` at a small generated shim
(`~/.codeman/dsh-status-shim.mjs`, written at session create) which forwards each
report to `POST /api/hook-event`. The mapping:

| Harness state | Codeman hook event | What you get                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blocked`     | `permission_prompt`| red "needs you" tab alert + an Approvals Inbox item       |
| `idle`        | `stop`             | definitive end-of-turn: respawn triggers, `wait` returns  |
| `working`     | `agent_working`    | clears an alert answered in the terminal, at once         |

So a DeepSeek session gets Claude-grade signals: `GET /api/sessions/:id/wait`
really can block on `stop` and `blocked` for it, and it is the only non-Claude
mode for which that is true (`hooksAvailableForMode`).

That is a per-*session* answer, not a per-mode one. Turning the bridge off with
`deepSeekConfig.statusReporting: false` means nothing will ever post a hook event
for that session, so an explicit `until=stop` is refused up front (with a message
naming the setting) rather than blocking for your whole timeout. Omitting `until`
never fails: the hook-only signals are dropped from the default set and you still
get `idle` and `exit`.

One limit worth knowing: whether the *profile* implements the contract cannot be
known at request time (Codeman deliberately treats an unrecognized profile as
launchable). A dsh session running a non-conforming TUI therefore still accepts
`until=stop` and will time out on it. `idle`/`exit` are the reliable pair there.

This is an interface implementation, not an impersonation — nothing on your
machine executes a real `herdr` binary. If you use a terminal profile that does
*not* implement the contract, the shim is simply never called and the mode falls
back to output-stabilization readiness like its siblings. Turn it off per session
with `deepSeekConfig.statusReporting: false`.

## 4. Starting a session

From the UI, pick **DeepSeek** in the Run dropdown (or the **Run DeepSeek**
welcome button) and press Run. Over the API:

```bash
curl -sX POST localhost:3000/api/quick-start \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "caseName": "myproject",
        "mode": "deepseek",
        "deepSeekConfig": {
          "profile": "dsh-tui",
          "permissionMode": "danger-full-access"
        }
      }'
```

`deepSeekConfig` fields: `profile`, `permissionMode`, `resumeSession`,
`resumeSessionId`, `statusReporting`. Resume prefers an explicit id over the
most-recent form, and both are passed through to the profile's app, which is
where `--resume` is understood.

**Models are not a session field.** The model is a composition entry in the
profile's config tree (`agent-default-model`), not a CLI flag, so Codeman does
not try to set one. Configure it where the harness does: `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`
plus a home-level `~/.dsh/cordis.patch.yml`, or a `--patch` overlay on the
profile. That is also how you point dsh at a local or third-party provider.

**Environment.** `DSH_*` and `DEEPSEEK_*` are allowlisted for `envOverrides`
(so `DSH_HOME`, `DSH_PERMISSION_MODE`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`
all flow through). Provider keys with *other* names are deliberately not: a dsh
`settings.yaml` can nominate any env var as a credential via `apiKeyEnv`, and
Codeman's allowlist is global, so admitting them would widen it for every mode at
once. Authenticate those the way dsh does, from the file or the server's own
environment.

## 5. Reading a session back, and driving one as a worker

dsh writes a real transcript — `$DSH_HOME/sessions/<mangled-cwd>/<id>/session.jsonl.zstd`
— so `GET /api/sessions/:id/last-response` reads that rather than segmenting the
pane, and the Response Viewer shows a dsh conversation the way it shows a claude
or codex one (`?context=full` returns prompt / response / tool blocks).

Reading the pane instead is not merely coarse for this mode, it is wrong: dsh-TUI
paints a full-screen splash, so the segmenter answered a `last-response` call for
a fresh dsh session with its ASCII-art logo — which anything polling for a
worker's first answer reads as an answer. Three things about the file shaped the
reader (`src/deepseek-transcript.ts`):

- **It is one zstd FRAME per append, not one zstd stream.** `zstd -dc` decodes all
  of them, Node's `zlib` zstd decoder stops at the first: a real 56-line
  transcript came back as 1 line. The reader walks frame headers itself. On a Node
  older than 22.15 (no zstd at all) the mode falls back to the pane, as before.
- **Not every `user/message` is the user.** Each turn also records a
  plugin-sourced runtime-context snapshot; only `source.kind === 'user'` is a
  prompt.
- **A failed turn is not an empty one.** `turn/end` carries the provider's error,
  which is returned as `Turn error: …` (and an early stop such as `max-tokens` as
  `Turn ended: …`) instead of an empty string that reads as "still thinking".

The transcript reader applies to **local** dsh sessions only. A Docker case's
harness writes its transcript inside the container's own `~/.dsh` (the workspace
bind mount does not cover it), and a remote-SSH case's lives on the remote host,
so the local reader could never find those files — such sessions keep the pane
segmenter, coarse but real. The splash caveat above applies to them accordingly.

### As an agent worker

Because dsh has both halves — a real end-of-turn signal and a real transcript — an
agent can drive a dsh session the same way it drives a claude one, and the bundled
`codeman` agent skill does. Spawning `beta:deepseek` in its worker list gives a
worker that is tasked, waited on and read with the same calls as its claude
siblings; no other external CLI mode qualifies. Two edges are worth repeating here:

- **Readiness is not the stop signal.** The harness reports `idle` at boot roughly
  300 ms *before* the composer paints (measured 2.26 s vs 2.56 s after spawn), so a
  send-and-wait fired immediately after create resolves on that boot report,
  reports a turn that never ran, and leaves the prompt in a pane that was not yet
  accepting input. Wait for the composer (`❯`) instead.
- **Wait on `stop`, not on the default signal set.** That set also carries `idle`,
  which for every external CLI is inferred from output stabilization; a dsh TUI
  that repaints rarely reads as idle mid-turn.

## 6. The web UI as a tab

The browser UI is the one interactive surface DeepSeek ships itself, so it gets a
shortcut rather than a run mode: **Run ▸ DeepSeek web UI…** starts
`dsh web --no-open --host 127.0.0.1 --port <free> --trusted-host <codeman-host>`
as a background child process (`src/deepseek-web-server.ts`, behind
`POST/GET/DELETE /api/deepseek/web`) and opens it as a Codeman web tab once the
server actually answers.

It is a child process rather than a shell session because the session version
opened a terminal tab nobody asked for on every click. What the session gave for
free is therefore explicit here: one instance with reuse, a restart when the
requested `--trusted-host` authority differs from the running one, a kill on
server stop, and captured boot output. The `--trusted-host` flag is load-bearing —
dsh fences its `/api` behind a browser-trust check on the request authority, and a
Codeman web tab reaches it through Codeman's own origin via the webview proxy, not
directly. Without it the page renders and every API call fails.

## 7. Docker and remote cases

Docker cases work: the agent image installs `dsh` and bootstraps a `dsh-tui`
profile into the container. Profiles are deliberately **not** seeded from the
host (each is a per-profile `node_modules` tree, host-arch-specific and far too
large to copy on every container start); only `~/.dsh/.env`, `settings.yaml` and
`cordis.patch.yml` are seeded, which is what carries auth and model composition
in. As with pi and grok, in-container sessions are invisible host-side:
`~/.dsh/sessions` inside a container is that container's own.

Remote SSH cases default to `dsh` through a login shell, which boots the remote
box's default profile. If the remote has several, name one with the per-host
`commands.deepseek` override — the local `deepSeekConfig` does not cross ssh.

## 8. What is not wired

Deliberately minimal, on the same reasoning as the grok integration: the harness
is a fast-moving developer preview and every flag added is a flag validated
forever.

- `--patch` overlays per session (the profile's own layers apply as normal).
- `dsh plugin` management beyond first-time profile install.
- The `headless` profile as a one-shot execution backend for Codeman's own
  internal AI checks (today those are Claude-only).
- Model/provider selection from Session Options.

## Verified against

`dsh 0.1.1-rc.2` and `@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui 0.9.0`. The permission
presets, the profile layout, and the supervisor contract above were all read off
the live install rather than from documentation.
